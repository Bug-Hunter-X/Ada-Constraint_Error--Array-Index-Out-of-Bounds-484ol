# Ada Constraint_Error: Array Index Out of Bounds

This example demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: `Constraint_Error` due to accessing an array element outside its defined index range. The `Get_Value` function attempts to access an element beyond the bounds of `My_Arr`, leading to the error.

The solution involves robust input validation or using Ada's range constraints to prevent out-of-bounds access.
